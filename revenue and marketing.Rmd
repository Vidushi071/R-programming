This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}


#since the target column is continuous we cannot apply classification model
#hence we have to apply the regressin modal 

adverts<-read.csv(file.choose(),head=TRUE,sep=",")
```

```{r}
pairs(adverts)

```

```{r}
plot(adverts$ marketing_total,adverts$revenues,ylab="Revenues",xlab = "Marketing total",main = "Rvenues and Marketing")


```
```{r}
#function we use for linear regression is : lm
#model<-lm(y~x,data=dataset)
model<-lm(revenues~marketing_total,data = adverts)
```
```{r}
model
# y=mx+c
#c=32.00670
# m=slope=0.05193
# for every 1000rs increase in the marketing value their would be 51.93 rs increase in the revenue
#marketing expenditure =0 when 32007
```
```{r}
#Equation:
#Revenue =32.0067+(0.05193*marketing_total)
# residuals=Predicted value - actual value(error)
```
