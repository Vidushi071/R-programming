This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
sales<- c(18,33,41,7,34,35,24,25,24,21,25,20,22,31,40,29,25,21,22,54,31,25,26,35)

time series analysis is a forecasting technique and can be additive and multiplicative
4 components :
  1.Trend(Tt) -> either upward or downward over a period of time
  2.Seasonal -> used to measure the seasonality index (increases based on the seasonal )
  3.Cyclical -> cyclical fluctuation have repeatative pattern with a time between repeatition of more than               a year whereas incase of seasonality the fluctutaion are observed within a calender year and           are driven by factors such as festivals and customs that exist in society
```



```{r}
4.Irregular  -> white noise or random uncorrealted changes that follow a normal distribution with mean               value of zero and constant variance
```


```{r}

Additive:
  Yt= Tt + St+ Ct+ It
Multiplicative:
  Yt= Tt * St*Ct*It

The additive model is appropriate if the seasonal component remains constant about the label(mean) and does not vary with the abel of the time series

while the multiplicative model is appropriate if the seasonal variation is correlated with label


```

```{r}
Measures to find the accuracy :
  1. Mean absolute error:  Summation( actual value - the forecasted value / no of observation)()
```

```{r}
Mean value % error:
  1MAPE : 1/n Summation (mod(actual value at time t - forecasted value at time t )/the actual value at t)*100%
```


```{r}
Mean sqaure error : depends on time series data
RMSE : root of MSE
```

```{r}
Forecasting techiques:
  
1. Simple ----Moving avg 
          ----Exponential

Regression ------ARMA (Auto regressive  moving avg)
          ------ARIMA (Auto regressive Integrated moving avg)
          -----MA(Moving avg)
          -----AR (Auto regressive)
          -----ARIMAX (Auto regressive Integrated moving avg with X)
```


```{r}

Moving avg method: 
  
  Ft+1 = 1/N summation (t to k=t+1-N ) Yk  ------- Simple avg

Weighted avg:
